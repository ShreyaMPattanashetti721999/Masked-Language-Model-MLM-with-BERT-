# End-to-end Masked Language Modeling with BERT
 
 
 
## Description
 
This repository implements a Masked Language Model (MLM) using BERT and fine-tunes it on the IMDB Reviews dataset.
 
### Introduction
 
Masked Language Modeling involves filling in blanks in a sentence using context words surrounding a mask token. This implementation focuses on predicting masked words based on contextual cues, demonstrating the power of self-supervised learning.
 
### Setup
 
Ensure you have `tf-nightly` installed:
 
```bash
pip install tf-nightly
```
 
## Usage
 
### Setup Configuration
 
Define model configurations including maximum length, batch size, learning rate, vocabulary size, and more.
 
### Load the Data
 
Download the IMDB dataset and prepare it for training and testing.
 
### Dataset Preparation
 
Vectorize text using `TextVectorization` layer, encode texts into integer token ids, and prepare masked inputs for the Masked Language Model.
 
### Create BERT Model (Pretraining Model)
 
Build a BERT-like model using `MultiHeadAttention` layer for masked language modeling.
 
### Train and Save
 
Train the Masked Language Model and save it for downstream tasks.
 
### Fine-tune a Sentiment Classification Model
 
Fine-tune the pretrained model for sentiment classification on IMDB reviews.
 
### Evaluate an End-to-end Model
 
Create an end-to-end model incorporating the preprocessing pipeline and evaluate its performance on raw strings.
 
## Requirements
 
- `tf-nightly`
- `tensorflow`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
 
## Notes
 
- Adjust hyperparameters, dataset paths, or configurations for specific use cases.
- Ensure compatibility with required TensorFlow versions and dependencies.
